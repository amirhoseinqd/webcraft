# WebCraft CLI

WebCraft CLI is a Node.js package designed to simplify the process of creating basic web project structures using vanilla JavaScript. With just a single command, you can set up a new web project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are interconnected and ready for development. As WebCraft CLI continues to evolve, more features will be added to enhance its capabilities and offer even greater value to web developers.

## Installation

```

## Features

## Usage

1\. **Create a New Project:**

You can use `npx` to run WebCraft CLI without having to install it globally. Simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```sh

Replace `<project-name>` with the desired name of your project.
